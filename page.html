	<h1>A Brief Introduction of Project</h1>
	<article>
	<p>Generally, Earthen roads are majorly used in construction sites and rural areas. Those roads are laid 
with available material in that locality. The material that which is laid as an Earthen road should meet 
the required standards.</p>
<img src="p1.jpg"alt="image of earthen road laying">
<p> Most of these methods are relatively expensive to be implemeted by slowly 
developing nations and the best way is to use locally available materials with relatively cheap costs 
affordable. So, to analyze the properties there are vast number of testings are there. Based on the 
properties we are going to choose the suitable soil. It includes some of the major testings like load 
transmission test, CBR test etc.... If the soil doesn't meet the standards then we are going to add 
different material (rock dust) that which are locally available to increase the stability of the soil.
We are going to perform the different testings on the native soils and determine the properties like 
index and engineering properties.</p>
<p>The properties we considered are,</p>
<p>• Density of soil.<br>
• Cohesiveness of soil.<br>
• Compressibility of soil.<br>
• Stability of soil.<br>
• Permeability of soil.<br>
• Drainage conditions.<br>
• Minimum changes in the soil after applying load.</p>
<p>Finally, based on their performance we are going to choose the soil which is suitable.</p>
<p>Every property of a soil is unique of its own nature. And we choose or determine the soil having all the 
properties which are necessary in stability of soil laying as Earthen road.</p>
</p>➢ Admixture’s: Flyash, Rockdust, Bentonite.</p>
<p>➢ Keywords: Native soil, load transmission, CBR testing, Stability, Drainage, Permeability, 
Cohesiveness, Particle size analysis</p>
